# 🏠 Housing Price Prediction Model

## Overview 🌐
Welcome to the Housing Price Prediction project! 

## Model Description 📜
In the notebook, we:
- 📊 Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the housing market.
- 🧹 Clean and preprocess the data for modeling.
- 🤖 Train regression models to predict the prices of houses.
- 📉 Evaluate the performance of our models using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Square Error).

## Interactive Notebook 📓
The [HousingPricePrediction.ipynb](HousingPricePrediction.ipynb) notebook includes:
- Interactive visualizations of data distributions and correlations.
- Code blocks for data processing and model training.
- Insights and conclusions drawn from the model's predictions.

## Key Findings 💡
- Key features that influence housing prices the most.
- Predictive accuracy of the models on test data.
- Suggestions for potential home buyers and sellers based on the model's insights.
